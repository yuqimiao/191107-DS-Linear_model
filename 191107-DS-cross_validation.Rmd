## Model selection is hard

Lots of times you’re not in the best case, but still have to do something This isn’t an easy thing to do

* For nested models, you have tests

– You have to be worried about multiple comparisons and “fishing”

* For non-nested models, you don’t have tests
– AIC / BIC / etc are traditional tools 
    * IC : information critieria, telling the goodness of models to different data; 
    * Balance goodness of fit with “complexity”
    
## Questioning fit

* These are basically the same question:

– Is my model not complex enough? Too complex? – Am I underfitting? Overfitting?

– Do I have high bias? High variance?

* Another way to think of this is out-of-sample goodness of fit:

– Will my model `generalize` to future datasets?

## cross validation

* randomly assigned the data into training/test dataset( usualy ratio is `80/20`)
* result is RMSE for prediction in test group

##?? why no fold?

## Comes up a lot in “modern” methods
– Automated variable selection `(e.g. lasso)` 
– Additive models
– Regression trees

library(mgcv)
```

# CV by hand

```{r}
set.seed(1)
nonlin_df = 
  tibble(
    id = 1:100,
    x = runif(100, 0, 1),
    y = 1 - 10 * (x - .3) ^ 2 + rnorm(100, 0, .3)
  )

nonlin_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

## split data using `anti_join`

```{r}
train_df = sample_frac(nonlin_df, size = 0.8) ## first sample training dataset
test_df = anti_join(nonlin_df, train_df, by = "id") # then use anti_join() to get test datset

ggplot(train_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = test_df, color = "red")
```

# Fit 3 models of varying goodness

```{r}
linear_mod = lm(y ~ x, data = train_df)
smooth_mod = mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x), data = train_df) ##use mgcv::gam for non-linear models
wiggly_mod = mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x, k = 30), sp = 10e-6, data = train_df)
```

```{r}
train_df %>% 
  add_predictions(wiggly_mod) %>% ## from modelr package, can add predictions from models to the dataset directly
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```

```{r}
train_df %>% 
  gather_predictions(linear_mod, smooth_mod, wiggly_mod) %>% ## gather together predictions results
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red") + 
  facet_wrap(~model)
```

## test results

```{r}
rmse(linear_mod, test_df)
rmse(smooth_mod,test_df)
rmse(wiggly_mod,test_df)

rmse(wiggly_mod,train_df)
rmse(smooth_mod,train_df)
```


* Choose the prediction score relatively instead of focusing on the absolute value.
* wiggly_mod is overfitting to the training dataset, not perform as well as smooth to predict.
* when the variables ammount is large, there is a trend to overfit; But wiggly is useful to select relative important variables.

## ??? wiggly model

# Using modelr to CV

```{r}
cv_df =
    crossv_mc(nonlin_df,100) ## create 100 pair of train and test datasets
```

## note about resample
```{r}
cv_df %>% pull(train) %>% .[[8]] %>% as_tibble
# it saves the data once and stores the indexes for each training / testing split using a resample object, resample just give the row index, need to use as_tibble to make it a dataset

cv_df =
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))

```


## using `mutate + map & map2` to fit the model and predict

```{r}
cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(linear_mod  = map(train, ~lm(y ~ x, data = .x)),
         smooth_mod  = map(train, ~mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x), data = .x)),
         wiggly_mod  = map(train, ~gam(y ~ s(x, k = 30), sp = 10e-6, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(rmse_linear = map2_dbl(linear_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_smooth = map2_dbl(smooth_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_wiggly = map2_dbl(wiggly_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))
```


```{r}
cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model,rmse)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

```{r}
child_growth = read_csv("nepalese_children.csv")
